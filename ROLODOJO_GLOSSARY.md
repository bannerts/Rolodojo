# 📖 ROLODOJO Glossary: The Dojo Lexicon

- **Dojo:** The local, encrypted app environment. It is the "training hall" where your data is refined and stored.
- **Sensei:** The AI agent logic layer (orchestrator). It manages the transformation of raw text into structured data.
- **Rolo:** The atomic unit of the system. Every interaction—whether a user input, an AI response, or a background system update—is a Rolo.
- **Summoning:** The specific act of a user providing input (text, voice, or image) to create a new Rolo.
- **The Master Scroll:** The `tbl_records` table. It serves as the central registry for every URI (People, Places, Things).
- **The Vault:** The `tbl_attributes` table. This is where "soft data" (specific details like gate codes or coffee orders) lives.
- **Synthesis:** An AI-generated Rolo created when the Sensei connects multiple existing facts to form a new insight.
- **Rockstone:** The architectural philosophy that the database schema must remain permanent and immutable to ensure long-term data integrity.
- **The Scribe:** The Sensei's function of parsing and writing data to the ledger.
- **The Librarian:** The Sensei's function of searching, retrieving, and presenting data to the user.
- **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier):** The dot-notation address for any object in the Dojo (e.g., `dojo.con.steve`).
