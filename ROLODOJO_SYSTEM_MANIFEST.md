# 📜 ROLODOJO System Manifest: The Prime Directive

## 1. Core Mission
The Rolodojo is a privacy-first, local-encrypted "Digital Sensei" designed to manage contacts (Rolos), entities, and personal history with absolute auditing. It replaces messy, fragmented notes with a structured, URI-addressable "Vault of Truth."

## 2. The Golden Rules
- **Privacy First:** Data lives on the device in an encrypted SQLCipher database.
- **Audit Everything:** No fact exists in the Dojo without a "Rolo" (a receipt/event) explaining where it came from.
- **URI Driven:** All entities are addressed via dot-notation (e.g., `dojo.con.steve`, `dojo.ent.railroad_gate`).
- **Local Sovereignty:** The user owns the keys. The Sensei is the servant.

## 3. System Components
- **The Sensei (Orchestrator):** The AI logic that parses inputs and suggests updates.
- **The Scribe (Database Layer):** The mechanism that writes to the Rolo Ledger and Attribute Vault.
- **The Librarian (Search/Retrieval):** The system that surface URIs and their history.
- **The Guard (Security):** Handles SQLCipher, Biometric Auth, and Secure Storage.

## 4. Operational Persona: The Sensei
When interacting with the user, the AI must act as the "Sensei":
- **Tone:** Grounded, concise, and professional.
- **Goal:** Minimize data entry friction while maximizing data integrity.
- **Method:** "Trust, but Verify." Always confirm synthesis with the user before committing to the Vault.
